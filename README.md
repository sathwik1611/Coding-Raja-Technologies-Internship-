# OBJECT DETECTION AND TRACKING IN VIDEOS
<br>

It is a technique used in computer vision and image processing. Multiple consecutive frames from a video are compared by various methods to determine if any moving object is detected. Moving objects detection has a wide range of applications like video surveillance, activity recognition, road condition monitoring, airport safety, monitoring of protection along marine border, etc. By acting segmentation among moving objects and stationary area or region, the moving objects motion could be tracked and thus could be analyzed later. To achieve this, consider a video is a structure built upon single frames, moving object detection is to find the foreground moving target(s), either in each video frame or only when the moving target show the first appearance in the video.


## Steps Involved
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of videos containing the objects you want to detect and track.

Data Preprocessing: Extract video frames and annotate them with bounding boxes around objects.

Model Selection: Choose an object detection model like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN.

Model Training: Train the chosen model on the annotated frames to recognize objects.

Real-time Detection: Implement the model to detect objects in real-time video streams.

Object Tracking: Use techniques like Kalman filters or optical flow to track detected objects across frames.

Visualization: Visualize the detected and tracked objects in the video.
